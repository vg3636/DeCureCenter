**Fully Complete Revision Prompt for De Cure Center Website on Replit:**

Revise the existing website code for De Cure Center to address the following, creating a fully functional website with content for all pages and a Google Translate language selector:

**Homepage Revision - Emphasize All Services:**

The current homepage overemphasizes prosthetic eye treatment. Please modify the homepage to prominently feature **all** the services offered by De Cure Center. This includes:

* Ophthalmology
* Vision Rehabilitation
* Ocular Oncology
* Prosthetic services
* Opticals
* Low vision aids
* Eye Plastic surgery
* Contact Lens
* Hospitality

**Implementation:**

1.  **Add a "Featured Services" Section:** Create a new, visually prominent section on the homepage (ideally below the hero section or in a clear, easily noticeable area).
2.  **List All Services:** Within this "Featured Services" section, clearly list all the services mentioned above.
3.  **Brief Descriptions:** For each service, include a concise and informative description (use the content provided below for the individual service sub-pages as a basis for these brief descriptions).
4.  **"Learn More" Links:** For each service listed, provide a clear "Learn More" button or link that directs the user to the corresponding sub-page within the `services/` directory (e.g., "Learn More about Ophthalmology" should link to `/services/ophthalmology.html`).
5.  **Visual Presentation:** Ensure the "Featured Services" section is visually appealing and well-organized. Consider using a grid layout, a carousel, or distinct blocks for each service. The design should be consistent with the overall style of the website as defined by the design reference image.

**Add Google Translate Language Selector:**

1.  **Implement a language selector:** Add a language selector to the website, ideally located in the header (top right) or the footer.
2.  **Use Google Translate:** This selector should utilize the Google Translate functionality to allow users to translate the website content into their preferred language.
3.  **HTML Structure:** Add the necessary HTML for the language selector (e.g., a dropdown menu or a series of flags/links).
4.  **JavaScript Integration:** Include the required JavaScript code to integrate with the Google Translate API. You can find instructions and code snippets on the Google Translate API documentation. Ensure the functionality is correctly implemented.

**Design Reference:**

* Maintain the overall layout, color scheme, typography, and visual style of the website as defined by the design reference image while implementing these changes, including the placement and styling of the language selector.
